 # Progressive Image Loading Implementation

 This document explains how progressive image loading has been implemented in the Image Generation Gallery application.

 ## Overview

 The progressive loading feature provides a better user experience by showing partial images as they are being generated, rather than waiting for the complete image. This creates a blur effect that gradually reveals the final image.

 ## How It Works

 ### Backend Implementation

 1. **OpenAI Responses API Integration**
    - Uses the `partial_images` parameter in the API call to request partial images during generation
    - The backend streams these partial images to the frontend as they become available
   
 2. **Streaming Events**
    - `progress`: Status updates (started, processing, generating)
    - `partial_image`: Partial image data with an index
    - `image`: The final complete image
    - `complete`: Metadata and final confirmation

 ### Frontend Implementation

 1. **ProgressiveImage Component**
    - Displays images with a blur effect that gradually reduces
    - Starts with a 20px blur and reduces by 2px every 100ms
    - Includes a slight zoom effect during the blur phase

 2. **Streaming Component Updates**
    - Handles `partial_image` events from the server
    - Updates the display with each new partial image
    - Smoothly transitions to the final image

 ## Key Features

 - **Blur Effect**: Images start blurry and gradually become clear
 - **Progressive Updates**: Shows partial images as they're generated
 - **Smooth Transitions**: Uses CSS transitions for a polished experience
 - **Loading States**: Clear visual feedback during generation

 ## Technical Details

 ### API Request

 ```typescript
 tools: [{
   type: "image_generation",
   size: size,
   quality: quality,
   partial_images: 3  // Request 3 partial images
 }]
 ```

 ### Event Handling

 ```typescript
 case 'partial_image':
   const partialImageUrl = `data:image/png;base64,${event.data}`;
   setCurrentImageData(partialImageUrl);
   break;
 ```

 ### Blur Animation

 ```typescript
 style={{
   filter: `blur(${currentBlur}px)`,
   transform: `scale(${currentBlur > 0 ? 1.1 : 1})`
 }}
 ```

 ## Benefits

 1. **Better User Experience**: Users see progress rather than a blank screen
 2. **Reduced Perceived Wait Time**: The progressive reveal makes the wait feel shorter
 3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication that the system is working
 4. **Modern UI**: Matches the progressive loading patterns used by leading AI services
